# The-Greeks-in-Financial-Markets

ðŸ“˜ Greeks Visualization â€“ Quantitative Finance Exploration
This project explores the Greeksâ€”key sensitivity measures in options pricingâ€”using Python.
It provides a mathematical and visual analysis of how Delta, Gamma, Vega, Theta, and Rho behave as the underlying asset price varies.

ðŸ§® Features
Compute and plot option price and Greeks (Delta, Gamma, Vega, Theta, Rho)

Use a basic Black-Scholes model (assumes a european_option class is defined)

Visualize how these sensitivities change with the underlying asset price

ðŸ§  Objective
To offer an educational and intuitive introduction to the Greeks, aimed at students and finance enthusiasts interested in quantitative finance and options risk management.

ðŸ“Š Output
Line plot of the call option's value across a range of underlying prices

Subplots showing how each Greek behaves with respect to the underlying asset
